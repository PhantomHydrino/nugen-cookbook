    "# AI Receptionist with Nugen\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern small businesses receive repetitive questions like:\n",
    "- “What are your hours?”\n",
    "- “Do you take walk-ins?”\n",
    "- “I want to book an appointment!”\n",
    "\n",
    "A human receptionist spends time answering simple queries that can easily be automated.  \n",
    "This notebook builds an **AI Receptionist** using Nugen’s Completion and Embedding APIs to:\n",
    "1. Answer common FAQs\n",
    "2. Detect intent (FAQ vs Appointment)\n",
    "3. Extract structured information (like name, date, service)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook is for:\n",
    "- Backend developers creating AI-assisted workflows\n",
    "- AI engineers building task-oriented assistants\n",
    "- DevRel engineers demonstrating API capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running:\n",
    "- Python 3.8+\n",
    "- Install dependencies: `pip install requests pandas`\n",
    "- A valid **Nugen API key**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Perform text completions using Nugen API\n",
    "- Classify intent of user queries\n",
    "- Extract structured appointment details\n",
    "- Build a simple receptionist CLI demo"
